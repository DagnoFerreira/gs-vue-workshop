# HOW TO

The project is as simple as Vue makes it:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Use a server to launch. I am a big fan of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)
- Use the branches to take the journey from zero to a full-blown todo app

You can also play with the [DEMO](https://christiannwamba.github.io/gs-vue-workshop).
